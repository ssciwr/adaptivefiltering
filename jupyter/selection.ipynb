    "The goal of this notebook is to find the best fitting filter pipeline for a given dataset (or rather a suitably copped subset there of). If you want to manually create the filter pipeline from scratch, you should read the [notebook on pipeline creation](filtering.ipynb) instead. Here, we assume that we want to leverage existing, community-contributed filter pipelines. In a first step, we select a number of filter pipeline candidates from filter libraries. Details about how to register additional filter libraries, can be found in the [notebook on filter libraries](libraries.ipynb). We use the `select_pipelines_from_library` function, which allows us to select any number of filter by keeping `CTRL` pressed while clicking additional filters. In the left most column, we see filtering criterions we can use to access the filter pipelines in our filtering libraries. The middle column contains a list of filter pipelines that match the given criteria. Clicking one of these will select it and show its metadata in the third column. Multiple filters can be selected by keeping `CTRL` pressed while clicking additional filters."
