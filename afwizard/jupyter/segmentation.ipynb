This notebook describes the details of how spatial adaptivity is implemented in AFwizard. It assumes that you have already created a suitable segmentation of your dataset into spatial features (e.g. in a GIS). We will then see how we can attach filter pipeline information to that segmentation file."

Also, it does not store absolute or relative paths to your filter pipelines, because these could always change when moving to new hardware or when reorganizing your project. Instead it stores the metadata of your filter (in hashed form) and compares it against the metadata of the filter pipelines in your currently loaded filter libraries.
